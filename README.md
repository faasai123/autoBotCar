The car's motion is facilitated by its four wheels. The front two wheels are driven by a Lego Spike Prime Motor, while the rear two wheels follow the turning pattern. The turning radius is relatively tight, and the wheels on the opposite side of the intended turn direction are engaged. The chosen motor, the Lego Spike Prime Motor, is connected to the Raspberry Pi Build Hat in the 2-wheel drive (2WD) configuration at the front of the car. The decision to use Lego components stems from the desire to position the motor on the lower section of the car, allowing for the placement of other components such as the downward-tilted camera body at the front. This arrangement ensures clear visibility of traffic lights. The car is equipped with an rplidar A1 M6 sensor at the front, working in tandem with the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi Build Hat atop the Lego chassis. These components collaborate to accurately gauge distances from curbs and traffic lights, enhancing the car's navigational abilities. Power is supplied by a rechargeable 12V 10A battery, which is then converted to 8V 6A using a converter. Additionally, a conveniently located switch at the rear of the car facilitates easy power control. The car's design prioritizes a centered center of gravity, achieved by positioning the relatively heavy battery at the center. This strategic design choice prevents wheel spillage during movement.
